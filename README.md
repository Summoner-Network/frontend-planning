# 🧭 Frontend Planning  
Collaborative space for shaping our frontend.

## 🛠️ How to Contribute

1. **Create your personal folder**  
   In the root directory (alongside `ref/`), create a folder with your name (e.g., `remy/`).

   <p align="center">
     <img width="200px" src="img/guide1.png" />
   </p>

2. **Copy the version you want to give feedback on**  
   From the `ref/` folder, copy the versioned directory you want to review into your own folder.  

   For example, if you’re giving feedback on:  
   ```
   ref/v1/Summoner_app.pptx
   ```
   Copy the `v1/` folder into your own directory so it becomes:  
   ```
   remy/v1/Summoner_app.pptx
   ```

   > 💡 *Only copy the version you want to comment on.*

3. **Add your feedback directly in the file**  
   Open and edit the presentation in your directory (e.g., `remy/v1/Summoner_app.pptx`).

4. **Summarize your feedback in your README**  
   Each personal folder should contain a `readme.md` where you document your feedback using the provided template.
